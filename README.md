## The Environment

Imagine you are selling bananas. One at a time. And the bananas get bad pretty
quickly. Let's say in 3 days. The probability that I will sell the banana
is given by

$$p(x) = (1+e)/(1. + e^(x+1))$$

where x-1 is my profit. This x-1 is my reward. If I don't sell the
banana, the agent gets a reward of -1 (the price of the banana).
